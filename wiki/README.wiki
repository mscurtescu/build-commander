= Introduction =

Build Commander is an Ant build listener that allows you to run arbitrary system commands triggered by build events.

Based on how build listeners are implemented in Ant, these commands can be hooked-in without changing the build scripts, just by providing external configuration files and an environment variable to instruct Ant to use this build listener.

These transparent hook-in mechanism allows in a heterogeneous team, for example, each developer to run their own OS specific commands to display notifications and start external applications like browser without impacting each other.


= Typical Usages =

Here are some typical usages for this build listener:
  * display a pop-up notification when the build ends, with a different message if the build fails
  * only when JUnit fails, automatically start a browser with the JUnit HTML report index page
  * automatically start a browser with the generated Javadoc
  * show a link to the generated Javadoc in a popup message window
  * launch a local deployment script when the build successfully ends
